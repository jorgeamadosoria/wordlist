# wordlist
Wordlist is a helper application for people who want to cheat at 4 Pics 1 Word without getting the answer outright. There are plenty like this.
You only need to input the letters and the length of the word, and the application will show a list of possible solutions for that case.

Clicking on each word will gray it, making it easier to exclude them while trying each one out.
There is also the possibility of filtering the words by the letters you already have, either as clues or because you bought some.

The list of words is available in: https://github.com/jorgeamadosoria/wordlist/blob/master/src/main/resources/words.sqlite
preprocessed to show all possible words in the list for each case.
